Description: powerful object-oriented display engine - runtime files
 The canvas widget is a powerful and extensible object-oriented display
 engine. A GnomeCanvasItem is a GtkObject representing some element of the
 display, such as an image, a rectangle, an ellipse, or some text. You can
 refer to this architecture as structured graphics; the canvas lets you deal
 with graphics in terms of items, rather than an undifferentiated grid of
 pixels.
